This package contains the utility classes for the Weka integration.
The class WekaConverter performs all operations necessary to transform
DataTableSpecs and DataTables to weka-Instances.
Furthermore, this class offers the possibility to check the attributes for
compatibility with a given classifier.

<p>
The WekaClassifierCreationTask runs the weka classifier in a separate
thread to enable cancellation of the learning process under Knime.
</p>
<p>
The WekaClustererCreationTask runs the weka clusterer in a separate
thread to enable cancellation of the building process under Knime.
